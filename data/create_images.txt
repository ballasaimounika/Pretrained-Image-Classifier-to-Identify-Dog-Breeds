Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, not all three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg as the same breed.
VGG correctly classified the dog as cocker spaniel, English cocker spaniel, cocker.
AlexNet classified the dog as flat-coated retriever.
ResNet classified the dog as gordon setter.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, not all three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed.
Only VGG classified both as cocker spaniel, English cocker spaniel, cocker.
AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as flat-coated retriever and Dog_02.jpg as scotch terrier, scottish terrier, scottie.
ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as gordon setter and Dog_02.jpg as flat-coated retriever.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures classified correctly Rabbit_01.jpg and Coffee_cup_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG performed the best.
It correctly classified both dog images as dogs and identified the correct breed, while the other models (AlexNet and ResNet) made incorrect predictions.
